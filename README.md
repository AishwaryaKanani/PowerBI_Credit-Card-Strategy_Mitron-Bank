# Problem statement
Mitron Bank wanted to expand its credit card offerings but needed data-backed confidence before a full rollout. A sample dataset of 4,000 customers across 5 major cities was provided to analyze customer demographics, income patterns, and spending behavior.

# What I analyzed
- Using Power BI, I built an end-to-end interactive dashboard covering:
- Customer demographics (age, gender, occupation, marital status, city)
- Income vs spending patterns and income utilization
- Category-wise and city-wise spend analysis
- Payment method preferences
- Monthly spending trends
